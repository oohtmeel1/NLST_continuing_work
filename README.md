# Continuing to work on Modelo
Modelo is the model I made when I participated in the AI data readiness challenge for the National Cancer Institute in April of 2024.
It is a binary classifier that was trained on data from the National Lung Screening trial. 
It can predict whether Cancer is present or not in a CT scan. 


The original model can be found at the National Cancer Institute:

and this repo:

Requirements:

`folder of JPEG images` <- A single folder of JPEG images. Containing both positive and negative files.
`train` `val` `test` <- csv files containing training labels
